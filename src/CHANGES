Major changes in version 2.3:

*  Terminal emulation has been significantly enhanced and bugfixed.

*  We now fully update the last character on the screen for true auto-
   margin terminals, though there may be some delay before the character
   can be safely added to the screen.  If your terminal has character
   insert it will be used to shorten the delay.

*  Added the "termcap" .screenrc command to tweak your terminal's termcap
   entry AND to customize the termcap generated for the virtual terminals.
   See also the -L and -O command-line options, and the SCREENCAP environ-
   ment variable.

*  Fixed screen's character handling when detached or suspended to NOT block
   the child processes in their windows -- output continues to be processed
   in the background.

*  Added a.k.a.s (window-name aliases) that allow you to customize the
   window-information line, including being able to change the name on-
   the-fly to reflect what's currently running in the window (see the
   -k option, shellaka command, and ALSO KNOWN AS discussion in the doc).

*  Added the ability to log the output of a window to a file (see the
   "C-a H" (log) command).

*  Flow-control can now be set for each window and switched interactively
   (see the "flow" command, -f option, and FLOW CONTROL discussion).

*  Individual windows can be included or excluded from mention in the
   /etc/utmp file (see the "login" command and -l option).

*  Added an activity monitor, which allows you to have a window watched for
   the start of any output and alert you when it occurs (see the "C-a M"
   (monitor) command).

*  Enhanced the information in the window-information line to keep track of
   windows that have: logging turned on '(L)'; beeped in the background '!';
   became active while being monitored '@' (see the "C-a w" (windows) command).

*  Added an on-line help display that lists all the commands and their
   key bindings (see the "C-a ?" (help) command).

*  Extended handling of the beep message (and also the new activity message)
   to allow '~' to specify a literal beep (see the "beep" and "activity"
   .screenrc commands).

*  You can now set the default action on receipt of a hangup signal:  detach
   or terminate (see the "autodetach" .screenrc command).

*  Routing of characters to their virtual terminals has been enhanced to
   not drop characters nor (in rare circumstances) hang up screen.

*  The NFS compatibility has been enhanced.

Major changes in version 2.0a:

*  Screen allows you to `detach' the "screen" session from the physical
   terminal and resume it at a later point in time (possibly on a
   different terminal or in a different login session).

  To get an impression of this functionality do the following:

     - call "screen" and create a couple of windows
     - type Control-A Control-D (screen terminates; you are back
       in the shell)
     - call "screen -r" to resume the detached screen

*  Screen supports multiple character sets and the ISO 2022 control
   functions to designate and switch between character sets.
   This allows you, for instance, to make use of the VT100 graphics
   character set or national character sets.
