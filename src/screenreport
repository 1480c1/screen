ISC 2.2 port!

"C-a : screen 11"  bug removed.

SunOS SECURITY PROBLEM FIXED.

C-A : bufferfile /tmp/screen-exchange

Detach() could crash in rare cases.

Dave Barr canceled the NeXT support as it likes to panic.

B43 to compile on a vanilla VAX running 4.3BSD (David Robinson)

C-A : vbellwait <sec>   defines the time the vbell will be visible

many little bugfixes: termcap keys, termcap NULL-ptr, resize forgot rows&cols.

SYSV uses uname() instead of gethostname().

XENIX support (Ronald Khoo)

MIPS support (J{rvinen Markku)

SVR4 support (Marc Boucher)

screen 3.0.7 what has been done. jw.
----------------------------------

pyramid and Ultrix support added. (Tim and Larry)
  
ENVIRONMENT support.
  /local/etc/screenrc checks for $SYSSCREENRC
  $HOME/.screenrc checks for $ISCREENRC and $SCREENRC
  /local/screens checks for $ISCREENDIR and $SCREENDIR
  .screenrc understands ${VAR} and $VAR .

.screenrc:
  screen now only opens the windows you explicitly ask for. if you 
  specify none, you still get one window, of course.

markkeys "string"
  allows to rebind the keys used in copy/history mode.
  string is made up of pairs "<oldchar>=<newchar>" which are separated
  by a colon. Oldchar and newchar are either single ascii characters, 
  or the two character sequence ^x, where x is an ascii character, or
  a 3 digit octal value prepended with '\'. the string "\040=.:q=^M"
  rebinds '.' to set marks, and the return key will abort copy mode.

set scrollback 100
  resizes the scrollback history buffer to 100 lines. a default of 50
  is installed. 

A Howard Chu like scrollback history is installed. Many vi-like keys
  are added to the copy mode. The '?' key reports on cursor position.

WriteString fixed, it did kill the display variable.

Yet another LP bugfix.

non vt100 semi-graphics character support.

wayne patches cursor motion outside scrollregions.

.screenrc 
  monitor on|off

screen -wipe

^A : set vbell_msg "Wuff Wuff"

Thousand enhancements: help resizible, copy'n'paste in main
  socket loop, and no more '\0' hackin'. :WS=\E8;%d;%dt:

screen sources and sun executable mailed to framstag@rz.uni-ulm.de (4.6.91)

screen can now resize windows under sunview.

^A : set crlf on|off
  effects markroutine join.

screen learned about sized windows under X

screen sources and ptx executable mailed to wgzb@munsqnt.uucp (28.5.91)

screen -ls (-d) -q
  quiet option. We count the number of detached (attached) sessions and set
  a return value of 10+n. The -q option inhibits all startup
  warnings/messages. i.e. screen -R -q may return with code 12 or higher
  or start a new/old session.

pow_detach_msg "text string"
  new command, allows messages, terminal reset, etc. on logout caused
  by pow_detach.

^A : learned a new keyword "set":
  commands like "login on" , "vbell off", ... affect the default for
  windows to be created. But commands like "set login off" affect
  the actual setting of this window. and not the default.
  such commands may be bound to keys. example: 
  bind 'O' set login off
  is valid in your .screenrc as well as typed at the ':' prompt.
  a bonus is ":set all" which is synonym to ":help".
  At the Colon prompt also KeyNames can be entered, alothough that makes
  not always sense.

^A x uses a builtin lockprg, if 
  a) we don't find our lockprg, or
  b) user supplies us with the environmet variable LOCKPRG set to "builtin"
  the builtin locks until your login password is typed. on systems using
  "shadow password files" you are prompted for a password.

markroutine can append joined.

screen removes the "controlling tty" from utmp while ptys are attached.

markroutine performs CR+NL when '\n' is pressed

screen may die quietly, when no TERMCAP entry for "screen" is
found, and screen is run under X-windows

_SEQUENT_ marks sequent386_ptx

screen runs now under SunOS4.1.1 (we need setsid()!).

bug in SetForeWindow fixed.

rare markroutine bug fixed.

we dont open every file the attacher tells us.

we have now our wonderful "Wuff, Wuff" visual_bell

we have now the interprocess-communication-buffer. secure version.

'^A =' removes the interprocess-communication-buffer.

markroutine as in 2.1

markroutine: 'a' toggles append mode,
             '>' like ' ', but immediately WriteFile(DUMP_EXCHANGE) then.
             'A' like ' ', but first switch to append mode.

.screenrc understands "screen 2:faui09 rlogin faui09 -l jnweiger"
                  and "password none"
                  and "vbell [on|off]"

'^A :' allows .screenrc commands "online".

screen now receives new $TERM from attacher, when it is reattached 

MakeClientSocket() fifo version does now test for access.

lock micha-like (attacher does locking).

power and remote detach working.

.screenrc learns "hardstatus {on|off}"

'^A : vbell on|off'   now affects fore window AND default setting.

termcap's VB is used for vbell if available.

MSG_CONT is no more different from MSG_ATTACH

Attach() code rewritten:
	screen now lists socket directory, if it does not find a suitable socket
	screen -d [host.tty] detaches a running screen. 

screen -[ls|list]
	list all sockets that we find in our sockdir

when the socket has been removed, send a SIGCHLD to the poor SCREEN 
process and it will try to recover. then try a 'screen -r' again.
all the socket stuff lives now in an extra file.

howard chu's  report-cursor-position-code added to ansi.c
