Installation of screen3.2

0.)
Unpack. Screen comes as a compressed tar archive. But... you probably
already managed that step, when you are reading this.

1.)
remove a file config.h, if there is one. Run make. You will be presented
with some compiler options. Correct them in the Makefile, if needed.
Compile with the right compiler. If you have gcc, use it. If you have
a SYSV-ish and a bsd-like compiler, choose the later (except on SYSVR4, whose
buggy bsd environment should always be avoided). E.g. on suns screen
will not run properly when compiled with /usr/5bin/cc.

2.)
Chose one of the config.* files listed when make is run for the first time.

3.)
You may well run screen from your private binary directory and with a 
private socket directory like $HOME/.screen. But to have a full featured
screen and (from a users point of view) more secure pty's you should
consult a system administrator and discuss installing screen setuid-root
in some globally accessible directory like /usr/local/bin.

4.)
The man page screen.1 should go to /usr/local/man/man1, or some similar
directory. It should format nicely with nroff -man. If it does not, then
try removing extra dots with: sed -e 's/^\.\././' < screen.1 | nroff -man 

5.)
Since version 3.2.15 the screenrc file syntax changed slightly. All rc files
from previous versions should be run through the newsyntax script that comes 
with this package.
